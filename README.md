# PumpIt-DrivenData



This repository contains R and SAS code for the [Pump it Up: Data Mining the Water Table](http://www.drivendata.org/competitions/7/) competition on [Driven Data](http://www.drivendata.org) by Giorgio De Caro and Mauro Pelucchi.

The data is provided by [Taarifa](http://taarifa.org) and the [Tanzanian Ministry of Water](http://maji.go.tz).
The original goal is to predict whether a water pump is functional, functional but needs repairs or non functional.
During the Master BI and Big Data Analytics we present this work as project of Data Mining course: the target is to predict witch waterpoint is to repare (vs no-repare). 

For SAS we use SAS Base (for pre-processing) and SAS Miner.
In R, we use [H2O](http://h2o.ai)'s random forest to get a score 0.76. We also used a XGB.
